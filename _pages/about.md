I love Linux, open-source, and technology in general.  

This blog was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. All updates and tweaks can be followed on by GitHub repo linked in the sidebar. 

I'm not very active on social media, but feel free to email me or leave a comment if you want to get in touch. You'll likely receive a quick response as I jump on any opportunity to talk tech.  

Thanks and Happy Hacking!
